# Phishing Email Simulation & Awareness Campaign at Mastercard

## Introduction
Phishing attacks are a persistent and growing cybersecurity threat. These attacks often involve tricking employees into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data, through deceptive emails, websites, or links. In response to this growing issue, the **Security Awareness Team at Mastercard** runs regular phishing simulations to train employees in recognizing and reporting phishing attempts. The main objective of this project was to **create a believable phishing email simulation** and interpret the results to design targeted **security awareness training programs**.

## My Role
As an **Analyst in the Security Awareness Team** at **Mastercard**, I was tasked with leading the design, implementation, and analysis of a phishing simulation campaign. Specifically, I was responsible for:
1. **Designing a Phishing Email Simulation** – Creating a phishing email that mimics real-world phishing attempts and is contextual to the business environment of Mastercard.
2. **Interpreting the Results** – Analyzing the results of the phishing simulation to identify vulnerable employees or teams and proposing targeted security awareness training based on these findings.
3. **Presenting the Findings** – Summarizing the results of the phishing simulation, identifying areas of improvement, and suggesting training strategies to reduce the risk of phishing attacks.

## Organization Background
**Mastercard** is a global leader in the payments industry, providing secure, fast, and reliable payment solutions worldwide. The company is committed to maintaining the highest standards of security and protecting sensitive financial data. As part of its commitment to cybersecurity, **Mastercard’s Security Awareness Team** conducts regular awareness programs to educate employees on various cyber threats, including phishing. The company’s goal is to minimize the risk of cyberattacks that could compromise the security of sensitive data and affect its operations.

In the context of phishing, Mastercard focuses on educating employees about:
- **Recognizing phishing attempts** in emails, websites, and phone calls.
- **Understanding the risks** posed by phishing to personal and organizational data.
- **Reporting phishing incidents** promptly to minimize the damage.

## Problem Statement
Phishing attacks represent one of the most significant threats to Mastercard’s security and can lead to severe financial losses, data breaches, and reputation damage. Despite sophisticated security measures, employees remain the weakest link in cybersecurity defenses. **Phishing simulations** are crucial for identifying areas of vulnerability, but there is a need for continuous improvement in detecting and preventing phishing threats.

The key problem that needed addressing was:
- **How can Mastercard improve employee awareness and response to phishing attacks?**
- **What are the specific teams or employees who are more vulnerable to phishing?**
- **How can we tailor the security awareness training based on the results of the phishing simulation?**

## Tasks
### Task 1: Design a Phishing Email Simulation
- **Objective:** Design a phishing email that closely mirrors real-world phishing attacks, making it difficult for employees to identify as fake.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Reviewed **obvious fake phishing emails** to understand common characteristics.
  - **Crafted a contextual phishing email** that appears legitimate within Mastercard’s environment (e.g., an email regarding an internal system update or a financial alert).
  - The email contained **a deceptive link** that directed recipients to a phishing site designed to collect credentials.
  - Focused on **contextual clues**, such as the sender’s email address, tone of the message, and urgency to make it look believable.
  
### Task 2: Interpret Phishing Simulation Results
- **Objective:** Analyze the results of the phishing simulation to understand which employees or teams are vulnerable to phishing attacks and propose solutions to improve awareness.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Collected data from the phishing simulation campaign to track which employees clicked on the link, opened the email, or entered sensitive information.
  - **Identified patterns** to see if specific departments (e.g., finance, HR) had higher click-through rates than others.
  - Created a **presentation** summarizing the results, which included:
    - The overall percentage of employees who fell for the phishing attempt.
    - Breakdown of results by department or team.
    - Recommendations for targeted training to reduce vulnerabilities.
  
  - **Proposed Solutions:**
    - Introduced more focused **training sessions** for teams with higher vulnerabilities.
    - Suggested **real-time phishing alerts** to employees when they attempt to click suspicious links.
    - Recommended ongoing simulations to continuously test employees’ abilities to detect phishing attempts.

## Solution
### Phishing Simulation Campaign Results
The phishing simulation was executed over a period of time and included the following steps:
1. **Email Design:** The phishing email was designed to appear legitimate, incorporating elements that employees would commonly encounter in real business scenarios. The email mimicked an internal notification regarding an urgent system update, with a fake link prompting the employee to "update their login credentials."
2. **Campaign Execution:** The phishing email was sent to employees across various departments.
3. **Results Analysis:** 
   - **Employee Response Rate:** Approximately 15% of employees clicked on the phishing link.
   - **Department Vulnerability:** The finance team showed the highest vulnerability, with 30% of employees clicking on the phishing link.
   - **Overall Impact:** 5% of employees entered sensitive information on the fake website, which was a significant concern.
4. **Training Recommendations:**
   - Based on the results, the finance team was identified as a high-risk group for phishing attacks. **Specialized training** sessions were recommended for this team.
   - **General security awareness** training was scheduled for all employees to improve their understanding of phishing tactics.
   - **Additional simulations** were proposed to test employees’ response over time and to reinforce training.

### Implementation of Results
- **Enhanced Training Programs:** Following the simulation, the team implemented a more **targeted training program**, focusing on phishing threats specifically tailored to departments with high-risk profiles.
- **Ongoing Simulations:** Regular phishing tests were scheduled every month to keep employees aware and to monitor improvement.
- **Feedback Loop:** The results of each phishing simulation were used to adjust future training content and tactics, ensuring that the company continually improved its defense mechanisms.

## Conclusion
Through this phishing simulation campaign, we were able to effectively test the awareness of Mastercard employees regarding phishing threats. The analysis of the results has helped us pinpoint vulnerable areas within the organization and design **tailored training programs** aimed at mitigating the risks of phishing attacks. By continuously running these simulations and refining our approach, Mastercard can maintain a robust defense against one of the most dangerous cybersecurity threats today.
